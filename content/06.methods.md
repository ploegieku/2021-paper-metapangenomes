### Selection of benchmarking species for pangenome analysis
We selected a species representative for each of the 23 phyla in GTDB rs202. 
To select representative species, we first filtered species with fewer than 20 representatives and greater than 1000 representatives.
While this approach scales beyond 1000 genomes, we elected to benchmark smaller sets to iterate over the potential parameter space more quickly.
Of species remaining after filtering, we selected the species within each phyla that had the largest number of genomes.
We downloaded these genomes from GenBank.
Species names are in table XXX.

### Calculating the gene-based pangenome with roary 
To calculate the gene-based pangenome, we first annotated each genome using prokka with the `--metagenome` flag.
We then used the resulting GFF annotations files to calculate the pangenome with roary using default settings.

### Calculating the k-mer based pangenome with sourmash 
To calculate k-mer based pangenomes, we used sourmash `sketch` to generate signatures from the prokka-predicted amino acid sequences (`.faa` files). 
We used the protein alphabet (k = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), dayhoff alphabet (k = 13, 15, 17), and the hydrophobic-polar alphabet (k = 27, 31). 
All signatures were calculated with a scaled value of 100.
The scaled parameter controls the fraction of the total k-mers represented by the sketch; a scaled value of 100 indicates that 1/100th of the distinct k-mers in a genome were included in each sketch.
We converted signatures from json format into a genome x hash presence-absence matrix.

### Correlating gene-based and k-mer based pangenomes 
Using the presence-absence matrices for the gene-based and k-mer-based pangenomes, we correlated total genes/k-mers observed per genome and total unique genes/k-mers observed per genome for each species.
We used the `rowSums()` function in R to determine the number of genes/unique genes per matrix, then used the `lm()` function with default parameters to correlate the values.
We also used the Mantel test to determine whether genomes that were most similar in the gene presence-absence matrix were also most similar in the k-mer presence-absence matrix. 
We used the `mantel()` function in the R vegan package to perform this test. 
We used distance matrices calculated with the `dist()` function using the parameter `method = "binary"` as input to the mantel test.

### Generating standard pangenome metrics with pagoo 
The pagoo R package provides functions to analyze bacterial pangenomes.
We used this package to generate standard pangenome metrics and visualizations.
These metrics are based on the presence-absence matrices generated above and include calculation of the core, shell, and cloud genome sizes and estimation of the alpha value in Heaps law for estimation of pangenome openness.

### Augmenting benchmarking species set to include genomes not in GTDB for open reading frame prediction
We next generated a benchmarking data set for open reading frame prediction. 
We selected a genome from each of the 23 species evaluated above, choosing the GTDB rs202 representative genome for each species.
Given that open reading frame prediction relies on a database, and we used k-mers in GTDB rs202 to generate this database, we also wanted to select genomes that were not in GTDB to evaluate this method.
We determined the bacterial and archaeal genomes that were added to RefSeq after the construction of GTDB rs202 (April 2021-November 2021).
From this set, we selected a representative genome from each of the distinct NCBI phyla represented among these genomes, 20 in total.
Genome accessions are recorded in Table XXX.
We then ran GTDB-tk on these genomes to predict the GTDB taxonomy of each.

### Simulating coding domain sequence and non coding domain sequence reads with polyester
We next created a labelled data set of simulated reads that were generated from either coding domain sequences (CDS) or non-coding regions within each genome.
We annotated the genomes with bakta to produce CDS ranges, and used polyester to simulate reads from CDS or non-coding regions. 
We used the default short read error profile within polyester.

### Determining short read open reading frames with orpheum 
We used the orpheum tool to predict open reading frames from simulated short reads.
Orpheum was developed to predict open reading frames in short RNA-seq reads from Eukaryotic organisms without a reference genome or transcriptome sequence.
Orpheum perform six-frame translation on nucleotide sequencing reads, calculates k-mers in an amino acid, dayhoff, or hydrophobic-polar encoding at the designated k-mer length, and then estimates the jaccard similarity between k-mers in each translation frame and a database. 
It then selects all open reading frames based on a jaccard similarity threshold, and returns those reads as translated amino acid sequences.
Open reading frames are excluded if they contain stop codons, low complexity sequences, or if the read is too short to perform translation.
Reads are designated as non-coding if they don't reach the jaccard similarity threshold and are not excluded for other reasons.
<!-- Is it jaccard similarity? It's whichever one makes sense and I always get them confused -->

We constructed a database from GTDB rs202 using sourmash XXX and using a k-mer size of 10.
+ @Tessa any relevant details would be very helpful :) 

### Metapangenome analysis of iHMP metagenomes
We used sourmash, spacegraphcats, and orpheum to peform metapangenome analysis of 12 iHMP time series gut microbiomes captured by short read shotgun metagenomes.
We downloaded samples HSM6XRQB, HSM6XRQI, HSM6XRQK, HSM6XRQM, HSM6XRQO, HSM67VF9, HSM67VFD, HSM67VFJ, HSM7CYY7, HSM7CYYD, HSM7CYY9, HSM7CYYB from ibdmdb.org.
We adapter and quality trimmed each sample with fastp (parameters `--detect_adapter_for_pe`, `--qualified_quality_phred 4`, `--length_required 31`, and `--correction`), removed human host sequencing reads with bbduk (parameters `k=31`, reference file https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3llHR93L14wd0pSSnFULUlhcUk/edit?usp=sharing), and k-mer trimmed reads using khmer `trim-low-abund.py` (parameters `-C 3`, `-Z 18`, `-V`).
We then used sourmash gather to infer the taxonomic profile of each sample, using the GTDB rs202 database (`k` = 31, https://osf.io/w4bcm/).
We summarized the results to species-level using the GTDB taxonomy.
We retained species with a cumulative sum of of at least 2% (sum of `f_unique_to_query`) across metagenome reads as query genomes.
Within each species, we selected the genome with with largest cumulative `f_unique_to_query` across metagenomes. 
We downloaded each genome from GenBank (**Table @tbl:acc**) and performed spacegraphcats assembly graph queries with each (parameters `ksize: 31`,
`radius: 1`, `paired_reads: true`).
Using the returned reads, we predicted open reading frames using orpheum `translate` (parameters `--jaccard-threshold 0.39`, `--alphabet protein`, `--peptide-ksize 10`) and using species-level GTDB databases.
We sketched each set of translated reads using sourmash `sketch` (parameters `protein`, -p k=10,scaled=100,protein`), converted each sketch to a csv file, and then combined csv files for a single query species across all metagenomes. 
This long format csv was used as input for the R pangenome package pagoo, using the `pagoo()` function.
We used pagoo methods `pg$gg_binmap()`, `pg$summary_stats()`, and `pg$pg_power_law_fit()` to visualize the pangenome, calculate the size of the core, shell, and cloud, and estimate alpha.
