# Discussion

We present a method to perform reference-free pangenomics.
We demonstrate accurate prediction of open reading frames in highly accurate short sequencing reads by comparing amino acid k-mers in all translation frames against a database of k-mers from all known bacterial and archaeal genomes in GTDB (rs202).
We then show that pangenome metrics like estimate of core, cloud, and shell pangenome fractions can be accurately estimated with long amino acid k-mers and k-mers from other reduced alphabets.
Combining these tools enables pangenome estimation directly from quality controlled short sequencing reads.
In the context of metagenomes, these approaches enable metapangenome estimation without the need to *de novo* assemble and bin sequences, eliminating common sources of lost sequencing variation (cite spacegraphcats).

The combination of these approaches is potentially most useful in the context of analyzing metagenome assembly graphs.
Assembly graphs like compact de Bruijn graphs (cDBG) capture all sequences in a metagenome, including sequences with high strain variation or low coverage, which may not be captured by other analysis methods. 
A targeted query of an assembly graph, for example with a metagenome-assembled genome bin, can recover all sequencing reads in a metagenome that originate from all genomes of the same species (cite spacegraphcats). 
While recovering these reads and assigning their taxonomic identity through graph queries is useful, many of the recovered reads cannot be assembled due to prolific sequencing variation attributable to strain diversity in the original microbial community.
Yet, the sequences represented by these un-assembleable reads often encode functional potential, some of which may be key to a microorganisms functioning within its ecosystem (cite sumner paper?; metachercant).
The approaches presented in this paper enable these sequences to be represented in pangenome estimation.

Long read sequencing of microbial communities stands to improve many of these challenges, particularly as lineage-resolved methods become mainstream (cite bickhart et al.).
Even as long read technologies improve, short read sequences continue to better capture strain diversity from a community (Cite Maureen?). 
Even with long read references from the same community, many of these short reads do not map and do not assemble (cite Maureen). 
The approaches presented here will allow these sequences to be included in pangenome estimation.

Practically, open reading frame prediction with orpheum can be executed on microbial illumina short read data sets.
<!-- Generalize? Include citation to olga paper here? -->
The RAM used to run orpheum is dictated by the database size, as the database is loaded into to memory while its running.
The GTDB rs202 nodegraph was 94 GB, and the RAM required to run orpheum never exceed 97GB, which makes database distribution and orpheum execution available on high performance compute clusters and other remote computers.
To reduce ram, this data structure could be improved XXX. 
<!-- Titus/Tessa? -->

We demonstrated that orpheum is better able to predict open reading frames in genomes that have species-level representatives in the GTDB database. 
To asses whether this criteria is satisfied by a query genome without performing genome assembly, we recommend sourmash gather. Sourmash gather will estimate the fraction of sequencing reads in a genome or metagenome that match to a genome in GTDB by comparing long nucleotide k-mers in the query against those in the database (cite gather paper).
Alternatively, the tool SingleM could be used to perform this task. 
SingleM estimates the taxonomic composition of sequencing reads by identifying fragments of single copy marker genes in short reads and comparing them against a database of taxonomically labelled sequences.

While it is necessary for the database to have a species-level representative for orpheum to achieve high ORF recall for a given query, it is not sufficient.
This likely reflects similarity in core genomes for closely related organisms, but prolific horizontal gene transfer between both closely and distantly related organisms.
Including genomes from increasingly distant taxonomic ranks in the database added XX additional true positives. 

<!-- Interestingly, while shared k-mer content between distantly related genomes improves ORF prediction, using reduced alphabets did not improve ORF recall. -->
<!-- We only did this for panmers, not orpheum...so for. Could show e.g. within phlya or some small db.  -->

Comparison between euks? Need to read orpheum paper.

PANMER discussion

+ sourmash signature generation is rapid.
+ Exact matching scales (linearly?). May enable running on very large collections of genomes.
+ Exact matching of k-mers enables additions of new species without having to rerun everything.
+ Exact matching also allows direct comparisons to distantly related organisms. Unified framework for genome comparisons even when organisms are distantly related.
+ scaled is handy parameter to potentially enable even larger comparisons
+ sacrifice function -- annotating k-mers with function is good future work. 

### Other points

+ While the number of genes per genome is increased for genomes with this exclusion criteria, there is no commiserate increase in the number of k-mers observed. 
This suggests that the number of k-mers in a genome could be used to predict the expected range of predicted genes in a genome, and could be potentially used a quality control metric for annotated genomes.
+ While developed for the metapangenomics space, this study demonstrates that k-mer-based pangenomes will also work in isolate genomes. Given that building k-mer sketches and exact matching of k-mers between genomes is fast, this provides an alternative approach for building pangenomes. 
+ De novo metagenome analysis probably dramatically improves ORF prediction because of the inclusion of these genomes in GTDB.
