## Reduced alphabet k-mers accurately estimate microbial pangenomes

To determine whether pangenomes could be constructed using amino acid or other reduced alphabet k-mers, we constructed pangenomes from amino acid (k = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), dayhoff (k = 13, 15, 17), and the hydrophobic-polar (k = 27, 31) encodings and compared these against pangenomes constructed from genes using roary. 
We constructed pangenomes for 23 species from 23 phyla in the GTDB taxonomy, ranging from 20 to 972 genomes per pangenome (average = 203).
For each pangenome, we compared the total number of genes and k-mers and the total number of unique genes and k-mers for each genome. 
We also tested whether genomes that had similar gene presence-absence profiles had similar k-mer presence-absence profiles using the Mantel test.
Performance varied minimally across encodings (**Figure @fig:violin_fig**) thus we performed the majority of our analyses using amino acid encodings with a k-mer size of 10.

+ @Tessa: Do we need to justify selecting a k-mer size of 10 here?
+ @Tessa: Do I need to show a comparison to a scaled of 1 here? I have it for 12 of the species, and the numbers are similar enough to scaled 100 that I stopped wasting the compute on scaled 1
+ @Tessa: should I compare this against nucleotide k-mers at all? Bc I think that's the underlying assumption here, nucleotides don't work for this stuff.

**K-size and alphabet do not impact pangenome estimation with k-mers.** Violin plots represent the distribution of R2 values for linear models (Total, Unique) or statistic values for mantel tests (Mantel). *Total* corresponds to correlation between total number of distinct genes and distinct k-mers in a genome. *Unique* corresponds to correlation between the number of unique genes and unique k-mers in genome. *Mantel* corresponds to a mantel test between the gene and k-mer presence-absence matrices.

Performance across metrics varied dramatically for different pangenomes, with k-mers and genes highly correlated for some pangenomes and not correlated for others (**Figure @fig:violin_fig**) . 
We investigated pangenomes more closely to determine the source of the poor correlations and found that they were caused by the presence of many frameshifted proteins, one of many potential criteria for exclusion of GenBank genomes from RefSeq.
For example, *Leptospira interrogans* had an R^2^ of 0.12 between the total number of genes and k-mers in genomes in the pangenome, however 21 genomes contained frameshifted proteins. 
Removing these genomes increased the R^2^ to 0.87 (**Figure @fig:frameshift_fig A,B**).
This trend was consistent across pangenomes, where pangenomes that had at least one genome that was excluded from RefSeq for having many frameshifted proteins had a significantly lower R^2^ values between total number of genes and total number of k-mers per genome than pangenomes that did not (Welch Two Sample t-test, estimate = -0.36, p = 0.003) (**Figure @fig:frameshift_fig C**).
Other RefSeq exclusion criteria did not impact the correlation between the total genes and k-mers per genome for a given pangenome.

We next investigated whether other pangenome metrics were well correlated between k-mer-based and gene-based methods using pangenomes that did not contain genomes excluded from RefSeq for having many frameshifted proteins.
For these 13 pangenomes, the percent of k-mers or genes predicted to be part of the core, shell, or cloud genome was strongly correlated (**Figure @fig:pg_fig**).
We also compared whether pangenomes would be designated as open or closed by calculating the alpha value for the Heaps law model. 
Alpha values were strongly correlated between gene- and k-mer based pangenomes (**Figure @fig:pg_fig**).

**Pangenome metrics strongly correlate between gene- and k-mer-based pangenomes.** Pangenome categories core, shell, and cloud refer to genes or k-mers shared between the majority (>95%), some, or singleton genomes in the pangenome. \Alpha is a value from Heaps law used to estimate whether a pangenome is open or closed.

## Jaccard containment between reduced alphabet k-mers and k-mers in databases accurately predicts open reading frames in short sequencing reads

Given that protein k-mers can accurately estimate bacterial and archaeal pangenomes, we next sought to determine whether open reading frames could be accurately predicted directly from short sequencing reads, as this would enable pangenome analysis without assembly.
We evaluated whether orpheum, a tool recently developed to predict open reading frames in Eukaryotic short reads (CITE), could also perform this task in bacterial and archaeal sequences.
Orpheum predicts open reading frames by comparing reduced alphabet k-mers in six frame translations of short sequencing reads against those in a database (jaccard containment) and assigns an open reading frame as coding if containment exceeds a user-defined threshold (CITE).
To evaluate orpheum, we constructed a database containing all k-mers in coding domain sequences from genomes in GTDB rs202.
Using representative genomes from the 23 species above, as well as 20 additional genomes not in the GTDB rs202 database, we simulated short sequencing reads either from coding domain sequences or non-coding sequences and used these reads to test orpheum.

Using default parameters, orpheum accurately separated coding from non-coding reads when reads were simulated from genomes in GTDB (**Figure @fig:orpheum_fig A**).
For reads simulated from genomes not in GTDB, orpheum recovered the majority of coding reads when genomes of the same species were in the database (**Figure @fig:orpheum_fig A,B**).
Accuracy decreased with increasing taxonomic distance between the query genome and the closest relative in the database (**Figure @fig:orpheum_fig B**).


For genomes that had at least species-level representatives in GTDB, the largest source of error was again non-coding reads being predicted as coding (**Figure @fig:orpheum_fig A**).
We hypothesized that these reads originated from pseudogenes as these genes would likely not be annotated as coding in the genomes the reads were simulated from, but may retain some k-mers contained in other genes in the database.
To assess this hypothesis, we used annotation files produced by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP), which annotates pseudogenes, for the XX genomes for which these files were available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5001611/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33270901/).
On average, 12.4% (SD = 13.8%) of non-coding reads that were predicted to be coding fell within pseudogenes annotated by the PGAP pipeline.
We then BLASTed a subset of the remaining non-coding read that were predicted to be coding against the NCBI nr database.
All reads we investigated had at least one mach at 100% identity to protein sequences in the database, suggesting our test genomes contained additional pseudogenes not annotated by PGAP, or that the software we used to predict open reading frames missed some coding sequences (see Methods).
<!--Indeed, the worst performer was *Mycoplasmopsis bovis*, with 23% of non-coding reads predicted to be coding. 
*M. bovis* causes bovine tuberculosis and its genome contains signatures of genomic decay and pseudogenization [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2017.02389], processes that may be linked to bacterial host specialization [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a010041; @doi:10.1093/gbe/evv135].-->
Because ORF prediction is blind to pseudogenes, it may not be appropriate for species with many pseudogenes.

[TR: RE -- BLAST. I could make a BLAST database of GTDB protein sequences and do this more systematically, but it doesn't seem that important, so I haven't done it.]

+ Why coding as noncoding? sequencing error?

Protein k-mers from predicted open reading frames in the simulated short sequencing reads recapitulated similarity between genomes estimated from the genomes themselves.
We estimated the jaccard similarity between genomes using protein k-mers (*k* = 10) from annotated coding domain sequences, and compared this against jaccard similarity between genomes using protein k-mers from predicted open read frames in the simulated short sequencing reads using the Mantel test.
Genomes that were most similar in one matrix were also most similar in another matrix (Mantel statistic = 0.9975, p < 0.001). 
The average similarity among all pairwise comparisons for the coding domain sequences was 2.6%, and this decreased to 2.5% when using the open reading frames predicted from reads. 

The majority of predictive capability originated from species-level databases.
We performed ORF prediction using just species-level databases for genomes that had at least a species-level representative in GTDB, and compared this against ORF prediction using the full GTDB database. 
On average, there was no change between the percent of reads derived from coding domain sequences when a species-level database was used versus when all of GTDB was used to predict open reading frames (SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE).

Decreasing the jaccard containment threshold increased the sensitivity and specificity of ORF prediction when there are no closely related genomes in the database (**Figure @fig:orpheum_fig C, Table @tbl:threshold**).
The jaccard containment threshold controls the final prediction of coding vs. non-coding, as well as the the number of open reading frames which a read is translated into.
We suggest the results in **Table @tbl:threshold** be used as a guide for setting the jaccard threshold based on the taxonomy of the organism relative to the organisms in the database.

## K-mer-based metapangenomics combined with assembly graphs ... 

Given that amino acid k-mers accurately estimated pangenomes, and that the correct open reading frame could be predicted from short sequencing reads, we next combined these approaches to perform metapangenome analysis from short read shotgun metagenomes.
We used 12 metagenomes from a single individual that were sampled over the course of a year by the Integrated Human Microbiome Project (iHMP) (CITE). 
The individual was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, a sub type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation along the gastrointestinal tract. 
The individual received three courses of antibiotics over the year and each course was separated by weeks without antibiotics (**Figure @fig:metag_species** height=2.5in).

](images/common_species_breakdown.png){#fig:metag_species}

We estimated the metapangenome for each species that was detected in all 12 metagenomes and that accounted for at least 10% of reads across metagenomes, for a total of nine metapangenomes (**Figure @fig:metag_species**).
To obtain all sequencing reads that originated from genomes of these species, we performed assembly graph genome queries.
We first built an assembly graph from each metagenome, and then queried into this graph using the genome of interest. 
Lastly, we predicted open reading frames from the matching sequencing reads using orpheum. 
Given that assembly graph queries return related sequencing content from genomes with as little as 10^-1 jaccard similarity (~93% average nucleotide identity (ANI), CITE TESSA, SGC), and that the general cutoff for species is 95% ANI (CITE), we used species-level databases to perform open reading frame prediction.

+ Do I need to compare these results against typical metapangenomics? like do de novo assembly, binning, prokka? etc?

## Extra results that don't really fit in the paper, but I could force them to fit or we could put them in a different paper

Lastly, we investigated whether the relationship between the number of k-mers in coding domain sequences in a genome and the number of genes in a genome was constant across diverse phyla represented here. (**Figure @fig:all_pw_fig**)
