# Introduction

Short read metagenomic sequencing has expanded our knowledge of microbial communities and diversity (CITE).
Many of these insights are attributable to *de novo* assembly and binning, which estimate species-level composite genomes (metagenome-assembled genomes, *MAGs*) from genomes in a sample, capturing unculturable genomes which have expanded the tree of life and and our understanding of microbial metabolism in diverse environments (CITE: Tyson, Hug, Nayfach). 
Along with these advances, the concept of metapangenomics has arisen as a framework for understanding how sets of genes that occur in closely related MAGs correlate with parameters in the environments in which theyre sampled from (CITE: Delmont, Bing Ma, Hoarfrost).
Like pangenome analysis of isolate genomes, metapangenomes reflect the metabolic and ecological plasticity of populations of microbes and give insights into the genes that support specific environmental adaptations (CITE: hoarfrost).

<!-- Really trying not to shit on de novo analysis, which really has given us many great things -->
Metapangenomics is reliant on *de novo* metagenome analysis, but both assembly and binning introduce biases into analysis (CITE: CAMI, SGC, Barnum, Maguire, Bickhart).
Low coverage or large amounts of variation (SNPs, indels, rearrangements, horizontal gene transfer, sequencing error, etc.) cause assemblers to break contiguous sequences, producing short fragments or unassembled reads that are too short to be binned into MAGs (CITE).
These biases disproportionately impact genomic islands and plasmids (CITE: Maguire), hot spots for evolution that support microbial adaptation to changing environments (CITE: Roth?).

To more fully represent the functional potential in metapangenomes, we present an analysis approach that relies on amino acid and reduced alphabet k-mers to accurately estimate microbial pangenomes. 
K-mers are words of length *k* in DNA or protein sequences. 
K-mer-based analysis has recently risen in popularity via sketching algorithms that sub sample sequences to facilitate rapid comparisons while maintaining similarity between samples (cite: Rowe). 
In particular, long nucleotide k-mers preserve similarities between closely related genomes but are brittle to evolutionary distance (CITE: metapalette, sourmash?). 
By using amino acid k-mers and other reduced alphabets, sequence similarities are preserved across larger evolutionary distances.
Combining this approach with accurate open reading frame prediction from short read sequences, this method can be applied without assembly.
<!-- Sigh. I think writing an introduction like this maybe makes graph-based analysis unavoidable -->
